# Setting up git
## Create a github account, here: 
https://github.com/signup

## There are two ways to clone a repo, depending on whether you want to use SSH or https. These can be seen in the 
git clone 


## If you need to change the remote origin for a repository on your computer: 
git remote set-url origin <your_new_repo>
# e.g.:
# git remote set-url origin git@github.com:marklescroart/UNR_PSY_427_627_Fa2024_ML.git
